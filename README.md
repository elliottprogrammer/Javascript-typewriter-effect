# Javascript typewriter effect

Here I am writing a string, one character at a time, into a `<pre>` tag, creating a typewriter effect, But I am also simultaneously writing the text into the DOM `<style>` element, which manipulates styles on the page in real-time.

I also programmed in css syntax highlighting for enhanced effect.
